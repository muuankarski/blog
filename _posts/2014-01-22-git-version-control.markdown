I gave a presentation at our [digicoffee](https://github.com/digieast/digicoffee) meeting on [git](http://git-scm.com/)-version control and how to leverage it with [GitHub](https://github.com/) for collaborative work and web publishing with title *Git version control & GitHub hosting service in creating and sharing born-digital content*. If you appreciate your born-digital content you deliver it in git.
